Data privacy and security are essential aspects of safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized access, misuse, or breaches. Data privacy ensures individuals' control over their personal data, allowing them to decide how it is collected, stored, and shared. Security, on the other hand, focuses on implementing measures like encryption, firewalls, and access controls to protect data from cyber threats. Together, they help maintain trust, comply with legal regulations like GDPR, and prevent identity theft or data leakage. As digital transformation grows, organizations must prioritize data privacy and security to protect both customers and their own operations.
